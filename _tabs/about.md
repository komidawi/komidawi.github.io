## My Projects/Repositories

## Bigger ones

### [AGH.Train-thesis-project](https://gitlab.com/komidawi/Agh-Train)

**System for optimizing seat allocation on trains**<br />
_Bachelor of Science Thesis Project, AGH, 2021_

This is so far the biggest non-commercial project I've taken part in. It is a configurable system to optimize seat allocation on passenger trains - a use case example would be passenger seating restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Another important functionality is optimization of the seat assignment process for efficient use of logistical resources and increased passenger comfort.<br />

**Technologies**: `Kotlin`, `Ktor`, `Ktor-OpenAPI-Generator`, `Kotest`, `Mockk`, `JWT`, `RAPTOR`, `Jackson`, `Gradle`

<br />

### [PizzaCostCalculator](https://github.com/komidawi/PizzaCostCalculator)

**Handy Android app which helps to make an optimal decision when choosing pizza size and shape.**<br />

Project focused on high code quality and proper coding and Android architecture practices. Much code written with TDD, high coverage levels. Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests. CI/CD made with Bitrise. SonarQube and CodeCov for metrics.<br />
I wanted this project be the one without any deadlines. It was supposed to answer the question: "If I had unlimited amount of time, how would the code look like then?"<br />

**Technologies**: `Kotlin`, `Room`, `JUnit`, `Mockito`, `Espresso`, `Gradle`, `Bitrise`, `SonarQube`, `CodeCov`

<br />

## Smaller ones

### [MyDinner](https://github.com/komidawi/My-Dinner)

**Recipe management Android app.** <br />

Initially started in Java and legacy, later converted to modern Kotlin Fragments, Navigation component and MVVM Android architecture. The goal was to learn how to write Android apps.<br />

**Technologies**: `Android`, `Kotlin`, `Gradle`, `Fuel`, `Gson`

<br />

### [PostgreSQL-Classes](https://github.com/komidawi/PostgreSQL-Classes)

**Database exercises of `PostgreSQL` and `PL/pgSQL`**. <br />

Although it's not a project, this repository is a valuable source of knowledge still helpful in my everyday programmer life. Even after years I use it as a straightforward reference showing usage of queries or functions.

<br />

### [PlatformPythonGame](https://github.com/komidawi/Platform-Python-Game)

**A simple, yet fully playable platform game made with PyGame.** <br />

It was the first project I have ever made. Although it's mostly just modified tutorial code, I like it as it's memento of my start with the "real IT world" adventure.<br />

**Technologies**: `Python`, `PyGame`, `tilemap`
