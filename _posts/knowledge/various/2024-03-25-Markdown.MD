## Adding Elements in Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab,
as shown in the following examples.

Tip: If things don't appear the way you expect, double check that you've indented the elements in the list four spaces
or one tab.
Paragraphs

- This is the first list item.
- Here's the second list item.

  I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

- And here's the third list item.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When theyâ€™re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

       <html>
         <head>
           <title>Test</title>
         </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.

## URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>

## Formatting Links

To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code, add backticks
in the brackets.

This is the _[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)_.
See the section on [`code`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code).

## Formatting the Second Part of the Link

The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., [label]: ).
The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets.
The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses.
This means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link:

```
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle 'Hobbit lifestyles'
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle (Hobbit lifestyles)
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> "Hobbit lifestyles"
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> 'Hobbit lifestyles'
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> (Hobbit lifestyles)
```
