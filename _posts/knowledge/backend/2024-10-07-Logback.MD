Clips from Logback docs with information I wanted to save for the future.

Usually I rephrase paragraphs in order to learn more and make notes concise, but in this case it's more like a lecture
rather than guide.

## Appender

> An Appender is a class that can be seen as an output destination.  
> Appenders exist for many different destinations including the console, files, Syslog, TCP Sockets, JMS and many more.
> Users can also easily create their own Appenders as appropriate for their specific situation.

## Main classes

> Logback is built upon three main classes: Logger, Appender and Layout. These three types of components work together
> to enable developers to log messages according to message type and level, and to control at runtime how these messages
> are formatted and where they are reported.

> The Logger class is part of the `logback-classic` module. On the other hand, the Appender and Layout interfaces are
> part of `logback-core`. As a general-purpose module, `logback-core` has no notion of loggers.

## Loggers

> Loggers are named entities. Their names are case-sensitive and they follow the hierarchical naming rule.  
> For example, the logger named `com.foo` is a parent of the logger named `com.foo.Bar`. Similarly, `java` is a parent
> of `java.util` and an ancestor of `java.util.Vector`.

> The root logger resides at the top of the logger hierarchy. It is exceptional in that it is part of every hierarchy at
> its inception. Like every logger, it can be retrieved by its name, as follows:  
> `Logger rootLogger = LoggerFactory.​getLogger(org.slf4j.Logger.​ROOT_LOGGER_NAME);`

> If a given logger is not assigned a level, then it inherits one from its closest ancestor with an assigned level.  
> To ensure that all loggers can eventually inherit a level, the root logger always has an assigned level. By default,
> this level is `DEBUG`.

> In fundamental contradiction to biological parenthood, where parents always precede their children, logback loggers
> can be created and configured in any order. In particular, a "parent" logger will find and link to its descendants
> even
> if it is instantiated after them.

## Appenders

> The ability to selectively enable or disable logging requests based on their logger is only part of the picture.
> Logback allows logging requests to print to multiple destinations. In logback speak, an output destination is called
> an
> appender. Currently, appenders exist for the console, files, remote socket servers, to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and
> other databases, JMS, and remote UNIX Syslog daemons.

> More than one appender can be attached to a logger.  
> Each enabled logging request for a given logger will be forwarded to all the appenders in that logger as well as the
> appenders higher in the hierarchy.

> In other words, appenders are inherited additively from the logger hierarchy.
> For example, if a console appender is added to the root logger, then all enabled logging requests will at least print
> on the console.

> If in addition a file appender is added to a logger, say L, then enabled logging requests for L and L's children will
> print on a file and on the console\*.

> \*It is possible to override this default behavior so that appender accumulation is no longer additive by setting the
> additivity flag of a logger to false.

## Layout

> More often than not, users wish to customize not only the output destination but also the output format. This is
> accomplished by associating a layout with an appender. The layout is responsible for formatting the logging request
> according to the user's wishes, whereas an appender takes care of sending the formatted output to its destination.

## Configuration

> The very basic structure of the configuration file can be described as, `<configuration>` element, containing zero or
> more `<appender>` elements, followed by zero or more `<logger>` elements, followed by at most one `<root>` element.

> At this point you should have at least some understanding of level inheritance and the basic selection rule.
> Otherwise, and unless you are an egyptologist, logback configuration will be no more meaningful to you than are
> hieroglyphics.

> The `<logger>` element may contain zero or more `<appender-ref>` elements; each appender thus referenced is added to
> the named logger.

> Note that unlike log4j, logback-classic does not close nor remove any previously referenced appenders when configuring
> a given logger.

> Similarly to the `<logger>` element, the `<root>` element may contain zero or more `<appender-ref>` elements; each
> appender thus referenced is added to the root logger. Note that unlike log4j, logback-classic does not close nor
> remove
> any previously referenced appenders when configuring the root logger.

> An appender is configured with the `<appender>` element, which takes two mandatory attributes name and class. The name
> attribute specifies the name of the appender whereas the class attribute specifies the fully qualified name of the
> appender class to instantiate. The `<appender>` element may contain zero or one `<layout>` elements, zero or more
`<encoder>` elements and zero or more `<filter>` elements.

> The `<layout>` element takes a mandatory class attribute specifying the fully qualified name of the layout class to
> instantiate. As with the `<appender>` element, `<layout>` may contain other elements corresponding to properties of
> the
> layout instance. Since it's such a common case, if the layout class is PatternLayout, then the class attribute can be
> omitted as specified by default class mapping rules.

> The `<encoder>` element takes a mandatory class attribute specifying the fully qualified name of the encoder class to
> instantiate. Since it's such a common case, if the encoder class is PatternLayoutEncoder, then the class attribute can
> be omitted as specified by default class mapping rules.

> The appenders are attached to the root logger by referencing them by name within an `appender-ref` element. Note that
> each appender has its own encoder. Encoders are usually not designed to be shared by multiple appenders. The same is
> true for layouts. As such, logback configuration files do not provide any syntactical means for sharing encoders or
> layouts.

> By default, appenders are cumulative: a logger will log to the appenders attached to itself (if any) as well as all
> the appenders attached to its ancestors. Thus, attaching the same appender to multiple loggers will cause logging
> output
> to be duplicated:

```xml
<logger name="chapters.configuration">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
</logger>

<root level="debug">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
</root>
```

> Appender additivity is not intended as a trap for new users. It is quite a convenient logback feature. For instance,
> you can configure logging such that log messages appear on the console (for all loggers in the system) while messages
> only from some specific set of loggers flow into a specific appender.

```xml
<logger name="chapters.configuration">
    <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
</logger>

<root level="debug">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
</root>
```

## Filters

> In `logback-classic`, filters can be added to Appender instances. By adding one or more filters to an appender, you
> can filter events by arbitrary criteria, such as the contents of the log message, the contents of the MDC, the time of
> day or any other part of the logging event.

> The `ThresholdFilter` filters events below the specified threshold. For events of level equal or above the threshold,
> ThresholdFilter will respond NEUTRAL when its `decide()` method is invoked. However, events with a level below the
> threshold will be denied.

> `TurboFilter` objects all extend the `TurboFilter` abstract class. Like the regular filters, they use ternary logic to
> return their evaluation of the logging event. Overall, they work much like the previously mentioned filters. However,
> there are two main differences between `Filter` and `TurboFilter` objects. `TurboFilter` objects are tied to the
> logging
> context. Hence, they are called not only when a given appender is used, but each and every time a logging request is
> issued. Their scope is wider than appender-attached filters. More importantly, they are called before the LoggingEvent
> object creation. `TurboFilter` objects do not require the instantiation of a logging event to filter a logging
> request.
> As such, turbo filters are intended for high performance filtering of logging events, even before the events are
> created.
