> _"When something is not yes_"

## Just wait
- Sometimes things that hang or stuck will just resume in a (longer) moment
- So try to get involved in something else and come back when you finish

### Examples

```powershell
langstream docker run test -app https://github.com/LangStream/langstream/tree/main/examples/applications/openai-completions -s https://github.com/LangStream/langstream/blob/main/examples/secrets/secrets.yaml
```

It took a massive amount lot of time - but it had to.  
And it eventually succeeded.

## Refresh (F5)
- Especially in browsers

### Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)
- Don't forget about this option

## Restart

I know that everything knows that (including me, of course), but not every single time it is performed!

- Restart App
- Restart Service
- Restart K8s
    - target pod
    - all pods
- Restart OS
