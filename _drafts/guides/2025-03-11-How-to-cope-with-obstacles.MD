When something is not yes

- Just wait
  - Sometimes things that hand or stuck will just resume in a (longer) moment
  - So try to get involved in something else and come back when you finish
- Refresh
  - Especially in browsers
- Hard refresh
  - Don't forget about this option
- Restart
  - I know that everything knows that, but not every single time it is performed!
  - Restart App
  - Restart Service
  - Restart OS
